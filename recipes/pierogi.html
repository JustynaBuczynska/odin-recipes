<h2 class="lista">Ingredients</h2>
<h2 class="main">DUMPLINGS</h2>
<ul class="lista1">
    <li>8 ounces leafy greens (spinach, amaranth, chard, turnip greens, etc)
    <li>2 ounces stale bread, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
    <li>About 1/4 cup milk, to soak bread
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated parmigiano or pecorino cheese, heaping</li>
    <li>Salt to taste, about 2 or 3 teaspoons</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 cup flour
    </ul>
  <h4 class="lista">TO SERVE</h4>
<ul class="lista1">
    <li>1/4 cup butter, duck fat or chicken fat</li>
    <li>4 or 5 large cloves garlic, sliced thin</li>
    <li>A squeeze of lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="main2" id="opening1">Instructions</h2>
<ol class="opis">
<li>Boil the greens in salty water until they're tender. This will range from a minute for delicate things like spinach or parsley, to maybe 4 minutes for New Zealand spinach or chard. Don't boil anything for more than about 7 minutes, or the greens will lose their pretty green color. Plunge the greens into a large bowl of ice water to shock them. Remove and squeeze the greens until they're just damp. Chop very fine and set into a bowl.
</li>
<li>Meanwhile, soak the bread cubes in the milk until they soften. When the bread is soft, mash it into a paste with your (very clean) hands so no large bits remain. Add this to the bowl with the greens.</li>
<li>Add all the remaining dumpling ingredients except the flour. Add half of the flour now, and mix everything well. Try to form the mixture into balls about the size of a walnut. If they hold together well, you're good to go. If you are unsure, add the rest of the flour.</li>
<li>Form the dough into balls, and roll each ball in a little flour. Drop the dumplings into the water you boiled the greens in and simmer them until they float, then about 1 minute more, about 5 or 6 minutes. Do this in two batches so you don't crowd the pot. Remove to a plate for the moment.</li>
<li>To finish, heat the butter in a large saut√© pan and cook the garlic slices gently until they just barely brown on the edges, about 1 minute. Add the dumplings and shake the pan to roll them around in the hot butter and garlic. When they're nicely coated, serve with a squeeze of lemon.</li>
